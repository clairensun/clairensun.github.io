							<p class="card-text first-text">The architecture of the United Kingdom, or British architecture, consists of an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from those that predate the creation of the United Kingdom, such as Roman, to 21st century contemporary. England has seen the most influential developments,[1] though Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have each fostered unique styles and played leading roles in the international history of architecture.[1] Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the United Kingdom, British architectural history effectively begins with the first Anglo-Saxon Christian churches, built soon after Augustine of Canterbury arrived in Great Britain in 597. </p>

					<p class="card-text sixth-text">Architecture and Culture, the international award winning, peer-reviewed journal of the Architectural Humanities Research Association, investigates the relationship between architecture and the culture that shapes and is shaped by it. Whether culture is understood extensively, as shared experience of everyday life, or in terms of the rules and habits of different disciplinary practices, Architecture and Culture asks how architecture participates in and engages with it â€“ and how both culture and architecture might be reciprocally transformed. </p>

				<p class="card second-text"> Architecture is about evolution, not revolution. It used to be thought that once the Romans pulled out of Britain in the fifth century, their elegant villas, carefully-planned towns and engineering marvels like Hadrian's Wall simply fell into decay as British culture was plunged into the Dark Ages. It took the Norman Conquest of 1066 to bring back the light, and the Gothic cathedral-builders of the Middle Ages played an important part in the revival of British culture.</p>

				<h4 class="card fourth-title"> Tudor </h4>
				<p class="card third-text">The Tudor period was the final phase of Medieval architecture in Britain, and covers the era between the late 15th and early 17th centuries. Typical features of a Tudor building may include masonry chimneys, grouped windows, half-timbering and gable roofs.</p>

				<h4 class="card fifth-title"> Baroque </h4>
				<p class="card fourth-text">Baroque architecture was popularised during the late 17th century and was regarded as a highly elaborate take on Classicism. The late 1690s saw the appearance of the first Grand Baroque country houses, with the most iconic figures of the movement including Sir Christopher Wren, Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor.</p>

				<h4 class="card sixth-title"> Georgian </h4>
				<p class="card fifth-text">The Georgian era of architecture lasted between around 1780 and 1820. It was influenced by Roman architecture, and usually involved classical exteriors and elaborate interiors. Walls were normally painted in a single colour and ceilings were divided into sections. Colours characterising the Georgian period included lavender, pink, pea green and light blue. Other characteristics included high ceilings and panelled doors.</p>
